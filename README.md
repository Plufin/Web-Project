# Web-Project

This project includes three main pages:

### Main page:
https://pluf.in/

### Gallery page:
https://pluf.in/gallery

### Commission page: 
https://pluf.in/commission

I've attempted to indicate where specific requirements are fulfilled for example,
as certain pages have features that others do not.

### HTML:
- [X] Basic HTML structure is present.
- [X] HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists).
-  Header, footer, nav
- [X] Use of forms, links, and media.
- Gallery and main page images 
- [X] Tables are effectively used.
- Main/Gallery: text.html
- [X] Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content.

### CSS:
- [X] Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts).
- [X] Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements.
- [X] Implementation of responsive design elements.
- Main/Gallery: media queries to apply different styles based on screen width
- [X] Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid)
- Flexboxing for layout
- CSS Grid in '.gallery' class
- [X] Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience.
- Color choices, typography, and spacing
- Specified font families, sizes, and colors
- Transitions (hovering images mostly)

### JavaScript:
- [X] Simple interactions (like alerts on button click).
- [X] Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations.
- Scrolling (navBar), opening/closing modal in gallery
- Fetching and displaying content in "Contact"
- Commission input fiels. Offers custom validation messages (for example email confirmation and submit alert)
- [X] Use of arrays, objects, and functions.
- Organizing and managing gallery section
- [X] Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates.
- Gallery provided in 'galleryData' 
- [X] Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles.

### Asynchronous Operations:
- [X] Use of timers.
- Commission after submit and hiding the navbar after three seconds 
- [X] Successful implementation of an AJAX call or Fetch.
- Contact at the bottom of the main/gallery. It fetches data from "text.html" asynchronously
- [X] Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage.
- [X] Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.).
- Error handling is implemented for the AJAX call. It checks the xhr.status and logs an error message if it's not 200 (OK)
- [ ] Effective use of asynchronous data to enhance user experience (like filtering, sorting).
- Unfortunately filtering is still under development
